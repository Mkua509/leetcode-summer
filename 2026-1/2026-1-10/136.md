I believe I am able to use a dictionary to complete this question, essentially by going through the list and counting we can see how many times that number appears in the list. We can then tell if a number has only appeared once in the dict by iterating through it and seeing each numbers count and return when the counts number = 1

```python
class Solution(object):
    def singleNumber(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """

        counts = {}

        for number in nums:
            if number in counts:
                counts[number] += 1
            else:
                counts[number] = 1
        
        for number in counts:
            if counts[number] == 1:
                return number
```

But there is a better way for space complexity this question is a bitwise XOR question where:

a ^ a = 0
a ^ 0 = a

Basically in binary XOR says that if the numbers are the same it will be equal to 0 but if it is different then it is 1. So if we take two values together from the list we will get 0 in the output. So essentially whatever the order you do it will spit out the same result and the final result will be the number which is unique. 

```python
class Solution(object):
    def singleNumber(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """

        result = 0 # n ^ 0 = n
        for numbers in nums:
            result = numbers ^ result
        return result
```
