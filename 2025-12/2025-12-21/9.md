Only have 20 mins for my daily leetcode (Gf birthday) so picked a leetcode easy lets see if i'm able to do it

So first thought how do we reverse the input number?

1. First a negative check if its negative it can't be a palindrome, so return `False`
2. Otherwise we will keep extracting the last digit using modulo (`%10`), append it to a new number, and remove the last digit using interger division `//10`
3. Once we complete that step we compare it to the original input
4. If equal then the number is indeed a palindrome

This is a pretty simple question I think but the time complexity could be better I wonder how we could make it better? 


```python
class Solution(object):
    def isPalindrome(self, x):
        """
        :type x: int
        :rtype: bool
        """
        
        if x < 0:
            False

        reverse = 0
        temp_x = x
        
        while x > 0:
            reverse = (reverse * 10) + (x%10)
            x //= 10

        return reverse == temp_x

```
