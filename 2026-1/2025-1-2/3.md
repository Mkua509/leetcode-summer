1. We are given a input string `s`

2. Output is to find the longest `substring` that does not contain duplicates

3. How do we solve this? We essentially have to go through the list and store the longest value as completely new value and check if there are any duplicate values and count for the longest sub string

We can accomplish this with a sliding window. As learnt yesterday, essentially first we must create a character set this character set will keep track of the amount of times a character appears but not its order which is good in this example. Every time there is a duplicate we can remove one of the values from the set and continue searching the string, the final result needs to be calculated by seeing the index right side - left + 1

```python
class Solution(object):
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        charSet = set()

        left = 0
        result = 0
        
        for right in range(len(s):
            while s[right] in charSet:
                charSet.remove(s[left])
                left += 1
            charSet.add(s[right])
            result = max(result, right - left + 1)
        return result
```

Sliding window will always be a O(n) when working with strings and lists

> Time Complexity : `O(n)`
> 
> Space Complexity : `O(m)`

This was a hard question i don't think i'm proficient enough in sliding window to fully implementing it without looking at the answers when will I be able to I wonder? Also i'm just not that great at working with strings too
