Group anagrams, my assumptions for tackling this quesition is if we check each word and check if the letters in the word match to any pattern/key in a dictionary and if it does then it will automatically be added to the array which is associated with that specfic key.

1. So we create a hashmap/dictionary where the 

* `key` = sorted version of a word (stored as tuple as it's immutable)
* `value` = list of words that match the key

2. We then loop through each value in the input list by first sorting the list, then use the key in the dictionary and then append the original word to the corresponding list

3. Finally return the `result`

The reason we choose to use dictionaries is because Hash maps allow for O(1) insertion and lookup this lets us group words effectively without comparing at every single word

```python
from collections import defaultdict 
```

Essentially the reason we do the above code is because if we try to access a key in a dictionary that does not previously exist it will output a error. defaultdict essentially creates a default value whenever a key is first used

```python
from collections import defaultdict

d = defaultdict(list)
# Create key a with 1 added to end of value list so [1]
d["a"].append(1)  


# Essentially the above does the below and then appends 1 at the end

d["a"] = []
d["a"].append(1)
```

```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution(object):
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs):
        """
        :type strs: List[str]
        :rtype: List[List[str]]
        """
        
        word_map = defaultdict(list)
        result = []

        # Word being current word in strings list
        for word in strs:
            # Sort them in alphabetical order
                # Mutabble data types cannot be keys s must be a immutable Data type like a tupple
                sorted_string = tuple(sorted(word))
                word_map[sorted_string].append(word)
        for value in word_map.values():
             result.append(value)
        
        return result
```
