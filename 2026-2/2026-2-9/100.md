1. Given the roots of two binary trees write a function to check if they are the same or not
2. Return True of False

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value. We could do this with DFS and recursion, so essentially we can look at each level first checking if the root nodes are the same, if they aren't we can automatically return False. Otherwise we can move down the tree and repeat the function until we reach the bottom.

With recursion we need to worry about base cases as well one is if Null in both trees, or if they are the same values inside.

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution(object):
    def isSameTree(self, p, q):
        """
        :type p: Optional[TreeNode]
        :type q: Optional[TreeNode]
        :rtype: bool
        """
        if not p and not q:
            return True
        
        if not p or not q:
            return False
        
        if p.val != q.val:
            return False
        
        return (self.isSameTree(p.left, q.left) and self.isSameTree(p.right, q.right))    
```
