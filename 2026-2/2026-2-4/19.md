1. Input is the `head` of the list and `nth` node which we want to remove from the linked list
2. Return its head


We can use a two pointer method for this question alongside dummy nodes. This is quite similar to some other questions i've done with linked lists. 

Essentially we want to iterate the right values to the n value first, then after the right value reaches the n value we then iterate the right to the end well also iterating the left value. We will notice that by the end of this action the left value will land on top of the n value which we want to remove, however there is an issue we can't remove this value without removing the previous pointer so what do we do??

We can create the previous mentioned dummy value and place the it in front of the head value, then the left pointer will start on that well right starts on right. In this case the left value will always end on n - 1 nodes meaning all we would have to do now is remove the pointer to the next value and then point it to the value after and voila the dummy node is removed.

One last thing is when we return the head we need to return dummy.next or else it will take dummy as the head.

With this solution we can thus say that everything was done in one pass without creating any new storage systems. 


```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution(object):
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head, n):
        """
        :type head: Optional[ListNode]
        :type n: int
        :rtype: Optional[ListNode]
        """
        
        dummy = ListNode(0, head)
        left = dummy
        right = head

        while n > 0:
            right = right.next
            n -= 1
        
        while right:
            right = right.next
            left = left.next
        
        left.next = left.next.next
        return dummy.next
```
