1. Input is a sudoku board
2. Output is if the sudoku board is valid or not if it is return True else return false

We solve this question by solving the rows and cols of the sudoku first, by checking for duplicates. This is done by using a set and a seen loop iterating through the rows and cols until we reach the end.

The squares check over all 9 sub boxes where each square is a 3x3 box the inner loop will walk through the inside of one square looking at the rows and columns and we then we map the squares using the board coordinates. This is done by using equations by mapping each block as a number from 0 -> 8 and finding out where the box starts using its starting row and column. Once we do that the rest is the same as the previous checks.


```python
class Solution(object):
    def isValidSudoku(self, board):
        """
        :type board: List[List[str]]
        :rtype: bool
        """
        
        # Check rows
        for rows in range(9):
            seen = set()
            for i in range(9):
                if board[rows][i] == ".":
                    continue
                if board[rows][i] in seen:
                    return False
                seen.add(board[rows][i])
        
        # Check cols
        for cols in range(9):
            seen = set()
            for i in range(9):
                if board[i][cols] == ".":
                    continue
                if board[i][cols] in seen:
                    return False
                seen.add(board[i][cols])

        # Check squares
        for square in range(9):
            seen = set()
            for i in range(3):
                for j in range(3):
                    row = (square//3) * 3 + i
                    col = (square % 3) * 3 + j
                    if board[row][col] == ".":
                        continue
                    if board[row][col] in seen:
                        return False
                    seen.add(board[row][col])
        
        return True
