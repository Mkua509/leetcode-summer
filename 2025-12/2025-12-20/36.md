Is this just a brute force question? I think its possible to use hasing but let me first use brute force.

Currently the way i'm doing it or atleast my thoughts is to first check the rows using a nested loop and checking first if the value is currently a `.` if it is then we continue and check if we have seen the next value but first intializing a `seen` list. If it is then we know its `false` since we know that from 1-9 it each number can only appear once. Then if everything passes we add it to `seen`. Then we repeat the same for cols. 

The tricky part is when we have to think about how to approach the boxes
