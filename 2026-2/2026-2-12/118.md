1. You are given a integer value indicating the height of the pascal's triangle
2. Return a list of lists where each sub-list is a row on the triangle

A pascal's triangle is a triangle where each value is the sum of the 2 squares above it


```python
class Solution(object):
    def generate(self, numRows):
        """
        :type numRows: int
        :rtype: List[List[int]]
        """
        result = [[1]]

        for index in range(numRows - 1):
            dummy_row = [0] + result[-1] + [0]
            row = []

            for i in range(len(result[-1]) + 1):
                row.append(dummy_row[i] + dummy_row[i+1])
            result.append(row)
        
        return result
```
