1. The input of this question is a string `s` which is all uppercase and a integer `k` this integer is the amount of times you are able to change letters in the string to get the longest substring (Changing B to A's)

2. What we return is the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you get after performing the swap 

My thoughts with this initially is that we might have to consider the time complexity of replacing each allowed letter with a sub list. But this would make the time complexity at the very least O(n^2). But the more I thought about it the more sliding window makes sense. For example if we consider that by using a dynamic sliding window where we set a character as the starting value, then we expand the window to see how many characters inside already match the starting character, if the number of characters don't match is more then the `k` integer we can conclude that the window is too large, so we shrink the value from the left?

We then do this for every character, with this we don't have to do any replacements and can focus on how many replacements are needed.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def characterReplacement(self, s, k):
        """
        :type s: str
        :type k: int
        :rtype: int
        """

        result = 0
        charSet = set(s)

        for character in charSet:
            # Count being the count of characters inside sliding window
            count = left = 0

            for right in range(len(s)):
                if s[right] == character:
                    count += 1
                
                while (right - left + 1) - count > k:
                    if s[left] == character:
                        count -= 1
                    left += 1
                result = max(result, right - left + 1)
        
        return result


```
