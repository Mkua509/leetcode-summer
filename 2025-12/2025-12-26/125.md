A palindrome is basically something that reads the same forward and backward. We need to convert everything to lowercase and remove all non-alphanumeric charcters.

This problem is essentialyl asking about subarrays instead of working with single eleemnts so we use two pointers once sorted. Because if you think about it the left and right needs to match at all times in order for it to be a palindrome. So if it doesn't match then we can automatically assume that it is false.

The main things to worry about is the changing from a uncleaned string to a clean string which I didn't know exactly how to do but now I do. The main ideas were using isalnum() and lower() by creating a new stringt variable. Then after that we just use two pointers to figure out if its a palindrome or not.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def isPalindrome(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: bool
        """

        new_string = ""
        
        for c in s:
        
        # c.isalnum essentially checks if a character is alpha numeric or not, by labelling as False or True it'll only pass the if statment if it is True. The true value will be added to the new string aftre getting lowered.
            if c.isalnum():

                # += adds to the list which I dind't remember
                new_string += c.lower()
        
        s = new_string

        left = 0
        right = len(s) - 1

        while left < right:
            if s[left] != s[right]:
                return False
            left += 1
            right -= 1

        return True
```
