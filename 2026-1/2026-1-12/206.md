This question involves reversing a linked list. We can essentially think of this as iterating throught the entire list and reversing the pointer values. We can do this by first creating a previous and current value. Iterate while curr exists and is not null repeat, and move the temp value to the next value in list, set the current values pointer to previous value, and move the previous and current value forward.

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution(object):
    def reverseList(self, head):
        """
        :type head: Optional[ListNode]
        :rtype: Optional[ListNode]
        """
        
        prev = None
        curr = head

        while curr:

            # Temp value is now the next value in list
            temp = curr.next
            # reverse the current values pointer
            curr.next = prev
            # Move previous value forward one 
            prev = curr
            # Move current value forward one
            curr = temp
        
        return prev


```
