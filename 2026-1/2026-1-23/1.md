For every from `0` to `n`, we want to compute how many `1` bits appear in its binary representation.

This bit manipulation approach checks each bit position individually:

- Integers are typically represented using 32 bits
- For each number, we test if the bit at position `i` is set using a bit mask

```python
class Solution(object):
    def countBits(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        res = []
        for num in range(n + 1):
            one = 0
            for i in range(32):
                if num & (1 << i):
                    one += 1
            res.append(one)
        return res
```
