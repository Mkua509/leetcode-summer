1. Given two separate linked lists which have a number reversed
2. Add the two numbers together after reversing

The question itself follows primary school level addition, where we carry numbers based off if a number exceeds 10. The problem is more with the edge cases rather then the actual question. Such as if one list is too long we might have to add a extra 0 to the linked list. 

Because the linked list is already in reverse order it actually makes the process a little easier for us since we do want to start from the base 1 to add so we can find the extra remainders to add to the next bases,


```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution(object):
    def addTwoNumbers(self, l1, l2):
        """
        :type l1: Optional[ListNode]
        :type l2: Optional[ListNode]
        :rtype: Optional[ListNode]
        """
        
        dummy = ListNode()
        current = dummy

        carry = 0
        while l1 or l2 or carry:
            v1 = l1.val if l1 else 0
            v2 = l2.val if l2 else 0 

            # new digit
            val = v1 + v2 + carry
            carry = val // 10
            val = val % 10
            current.next = ListNode(val)

            current = current.next
            l1 = l1.next if l1 else None
            l2 = l2.next if l2 else None
        
        return dummy.next
```
