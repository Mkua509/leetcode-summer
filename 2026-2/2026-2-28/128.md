1. given an unsorted list of integers
2. Return the length of longest consecutive elements.

In order to avoid counting the same number over and over again we only want ot start counting when we find the beginning of the sequence. A number is the start of a list if num - 1 is not in the set. This guarantees it is a unique sequence each time.

Once we identify the number we then iterate thorough the list. Extending the streak as far as possible.


```python
class Solution(object):
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        numSet = set(nums)
        longest = 0

        for num in numSet:
            if (num - 1) not in numSet:
                length = 1
                while (num + length) in numSet:
                    length += 1
                longest = max(length, longest)
        
        return longest
```
