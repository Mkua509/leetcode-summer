1. Given an integer array of 2n integers
2. Group the integers into n pairs such that the sum of min(a, b) for all index is maximized. Return the max sum

The entire idea to think about is how do we pair numbers to make the sum of minimums as large as possible. So the if we pair a small number with a very large number, the minimum of that pair will still be the small number so the large number is essentially wasted. But this can be solved if the pair numbers are closer in size meaning that the smallest number in the pair will always be as large as possible.

This is where sorting comes in, we sort the array then we pair the adjacent elements then we add the first element of each pair by using a min function.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def arrayPairSum(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        nums.sort()
        total = 0
        
        for i in range(0, len(nums), 2):
            total += nums[i]
        
        return total
```
