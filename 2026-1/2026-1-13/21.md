1. The input is the heads of two sorted linked lists 

2. the output should be a sorted list of the two

idk tbh this is legit just playing around with linked lists more of a code first figure out later type thing.


```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution(object):
    def mergeTwoLists(self, list1, list2):
        """
        :type list1: Optional[ListNode]
        :type list2: Optional[ListNode]
        :rtype: Optional[ListNode]
        """

        # Dummy head essentially a empty head which means when we iterate next it will be the head no matter what
        temp = ListNode()
        current = temp

        while list1 and list2:
            if list1.val < list2.val:
                current.next = list1
                list1 = list1.next
            else:
                current.next = list2
                list2 = list2.next
            
            current = current.next
        

        # When one list is empty if list1 still has items the next items will just be list1 and vice versa
        if list1:
            current.next = list1
        else:
            current.next = list2
        
        return temp.next
```
