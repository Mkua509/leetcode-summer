1. Given two strings s and t 
2. Return true if t is an anagram of s false otherwise

The way we tackle this question is by using dictionaries because we have to count the total number of times each letter appears and compare the two words based off the count of letters. 

First check if the lengths match if they don't then that means that the length is automatically false.

Then we initialize two dictionaries one for s and one for t. 

Once we do that we run a for loop for each index in the list so that we can run through each value. We use dictionaries to check if the current word we are on has any count and add 1 to that count, otherwise start the count and set it to 0. Repeat for all words for both s and t. 

Once that is completed we now have two full dictionaries with both words and the count of each letter based off appearance. 

We can then match the two dictionaries to see if they are the same if they aren't then we return False but if they are return True.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def isAnagram(self, s, t):
        """
        :type s: str
        :type t: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
        
        if len(s) != len(t):
            return False

        dict_s, dict_t = {}, {}

        for i in range(len(s)):
            dict_s[s[i]] = 1 + dict_s.get(s[i], 0)
            dict_t[t[i]] = 1 + dict_t.get(t[i], 0)
        
        if dict_s == dict_t:
            return True
        
        return False
```
