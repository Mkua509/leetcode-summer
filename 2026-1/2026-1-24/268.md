Idk its just a super eas question I think...

```python
class Solution(object):
    def missingNumber(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """

        result = len(nums)

        for i in range(len(nums)):
            result += i - nums[i]
        
        return result
```
