This question requires understanding of what reverse polar expression is.

The main thing to note is that the operators (e.g. addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) all follow their operands (numbers). So if we were to add like 2 and 5 together the mathematical expression becomes `2 5 +` compared to the normal `2 + 5`.

We can use a stack to create this application as it is in a last in first out construct. Basically the most recent numbers are always the ones used next as we scan the tokens. 

When a number is seen we push it into a stack and when we see an operator, we take the top two numbers, apply the operation and push the result back onto the stack.

This allows the stack and calculations to be accurate similar to BEDMAS 


```python
class Solution(object):
    def evalRPN(self, tokens):
        """
        :type tokens: List[str]
        :rtype: int
        """

        stack = []

        for current in tokens:
            if current == '+':
                stack.append(stack.pop() + stack.pop())
            elif current == '*':
                stack.append(stack.pop() * stack.pop())
            elif current == '/':
                a = stack.pop()
                b = stack.pop()

                stack.append(int(float(b) / a))
            elif current == '-':
                a = stack.pop() 
                b = stack.pop() 
                stack.append(b - a)
            else:
                stack.append(int(current))
                
        return stack[0]     
```

One thing to note for division and subtraction is that we need to put the end value into the start value.
