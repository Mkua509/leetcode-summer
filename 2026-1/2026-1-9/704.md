Hard day today went on a fat hike and then afterwards went to the beach and got TWO leg cramps on both legs actually crazy but its okay had to pick a easy one because only have 30 mins left.

Todays topic binary search, super easy algorithm the implementation should be O(log n) based on my memory. How binary search works essentially you are given a sorted list and you find the middle value of that list and check if that value is more or less then the value you want to find. If it is less then you can automatically assume all the right side is now null else the other side applies. Repeat until you find the index of value. 

```python
class Solution(object):
    def search(self, nums, target):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        
        low = 0
        high = len(nums) - 1

        while low <= high:
        
            mid = low + (high - low) // 2

            if nums[mid] == target:
                return mid

            elif nums[mid] < target:
                low = mid + 1

            else: 
                high = mid -1
        
        return - 1
```
