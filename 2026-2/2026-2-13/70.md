1. You are given n value based off how many steps it takes to get ot the top
2. You can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can we reach the top?

At any step, the number of ways depends only on the previous two steps. So instead of storing all values in a DP array, we can just keep two variables that represent::

- ways to reach the previous step
- Ways to reach the step before that

its super similar to a the fubonacci idea but for constant space

```python
class Solution(object):
    def climbStairs(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        
        one, two = 1, 1

        for i in range(n - 1):
            temp = one
            one = one + two
            two = temp
        
        return one
```
