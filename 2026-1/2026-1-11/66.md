1. The input for this question is a array containing individual values of the numbers e.g. [1,2,3,4] is basically 1234

2. the return is a array containing the combination of numbers but + 1

We can essentially always increment +1 to the last digit if it is less then 9, however as soon as the value is 9 we need it increment the value before it until it is no longer 9

```python
class Solution(object):
    def plusOne(self, digits):
        """
        :type digits: List[int]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        
        if not digits:
            return[1]
        
        if digits[-1] < 9:
            digits[-1] += 1
            return digits
        else:
            return self.plusOne(digits[:-1]) + [0]
```
