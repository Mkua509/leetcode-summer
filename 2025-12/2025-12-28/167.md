This is under Two Pointers so its pretty obvious what to do especially since i've completed the Valid Palindrome one. The assumption is that its already a sorted list, so we can essentially use two pointers to go from left and right at the same time to check if the current sum of numbers is the target number. If the number is too small then we move the left pointer up and if the number is too large we move the right pointer down and because its sorted it will basically just go down until it finds the correct value only going through each item in the list once.



```python
class Solution(object):
    def twoSum(self, numbers, target):
        """
        :type numbers: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        left = 0
        right = len(numbers) - 1

        while left < right:
            cursorSum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]

            if cursorSum > target:
                right -= 1
            elif cursorSum < target:
                left += 1
            else:
                return [left + 1 , right + 1]
    
```
