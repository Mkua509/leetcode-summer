1. Input is the `root` of a tree
2. output is the maximum depth of the tree

I feel like a lot of these tree questions are pretty self explanatory if you've worked with Binary Trees in general, in this case we just use recursion again. First check if the root has a value, if its Null then return 0. Else check the left and right tree by using recursion on the left or right of the root. Then check the maximum value of the two and add 1 because of the root value. Then return the value.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def maxDepth(self, root):
        """
        :type root: Optional[TreeNode]
        :rtype: int
        """
        
        if root is None:
            return 0
        
        leftTree = self.maxDepth(root.left)
        rightTree = self.maxDepth(root.right)
        value = max(leftTree, rightTree) + 1

        return value
```
