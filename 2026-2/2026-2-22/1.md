1. Input is a array called nums and a target value
2. If there are two values in nums that add up to target return the index of those two numbers in num

Because its a index question we have to make a dict where the key is the value and the value is the index lol.

So first we create the dictionary and in order to fill up the dictionary with both the index and values we have to use enumerate.

Enumerate() essentially allows us to set both a value and a index to different variables making the process easier.

Then we use the equation of difference = target - num[i] to find the difference we then check if the difference has appeared inside of the dict before. If it hasn't then we add the current num[i] value into the dictionary with its corresponding index. e.g. HashPrev[nums[i]] = index

```python
class Solution(object):
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        HashPrev = {}

        for index, numbers in enumerate(nums):
            difference = target - numbers

            if difference in HashPrev:
                return [HashPrev[difference], index]
            
            HashPrev[nums[index]] = index
```
