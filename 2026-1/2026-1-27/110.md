1. Input is a binary tree root

2. Return True if it is height balanced and false otherwise 

What does height balanced mean? It essentially means when the absolute difference between the left and right subtrees for every node is no more then 1

The easiest way of doing this question is by using depth first search, we will essentially use recursion to search each layer of the tree after the root and see if the difference between left and right is more less then equal to one and return a boolean

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

class Solution:
    def isBalanced(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        def dfs(root):
            if not root:
                # Is balanced and height = 0
                return [True, 0]

            left, right = dfs(root.left), dfs(root.right)
            # Here we must consider that dfs returns boolean left[0]/right[0] requires that the tree is already balanced as one of its requirements 
            balanced = left[0] and right[0] and abs(left[1] - right[1]) <= 1
            return [balanced, 1 + max(left[1], right[1])]
        
        # Remeber that dfs returns a list value, in this case we will return if the value is balanced (True, False)
        return dfs(root)[0]
```
