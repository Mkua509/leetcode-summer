I'm running back a few hash map and Array questions just to test my memory

1. The input of this question is an integer array of nums
2. Return True if it is duplicate else False

We essentially want to use a set() check if the value is in set already if it's not then we add to the set else it already exists in the set.

Damn i forgot how to use a set(), you can't append into a set() you have to use the .add(). One other thing to mention is that we can't initialize the set using the given nums because if we do that set will use all of the numbers and remove the duplicates so we have to add it one by one.


```python
class Solution(object):
    def containsDuplicate(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: bool
        """

        set_nums = set()

        for numbers in nums:
            if numbers in set_nums:
                return True
            else:
                set_nums.add(numbers)
        
        return False
```

The in look up and add in sets are both O(1) average so for n interactions it becomes O(n) while storing up to O(n) items into the set.
