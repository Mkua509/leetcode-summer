1. The input is a palindrome
2. Return if it is a palindrome or not 

We are able to do this by using two pointer by starting on the left and right and iterating inwards until the pointers meet.

If the current left and right is not equal to left and right pointers then we can assume it's false because a palindrome requires the letters to be the same on both ends.

We also need to consider the none letters because if the phrase has many different spaces in differing areas it will assume it is false.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def isPalindrome(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
        l, r = 0, len(s) - 1

        while l < r:
            while l < r and not self.alphaNum(s[l]):
                l += 1
            while r > l and not self.alphaNum(s[r]):
                r -= 1
            if s[l].lower() != s[r].lower():
                return False
            l, r = l + 1, r - 1
        return True

    def alphaNum(self, c):
        return (ord('A') <= ord(c) <= ord('Z') or
                ord('a') <= ord(c) <= ord('z') or
                ord('0') <= ord(c) <= ord('9'))

```
