1. Given an integer value n
2. Return a string array where: 

- `answer[i] == "FizzBuzz"` if i is divisible by `3` and `5`
- `answer[i] == "Fizz"` if i is divisible by `3` 
- `answer[i] == "Buzz"` if i is divisible by `5`
- `answer[i] == i` (as a string) if none is true

The only thing you really have to worry about is the very first line, because its possible if the condition is not set properly its possible it might misinterpret the value as something only divisible by 3 or 5 and printing out only Fizz or Buzz.

The easiest way to solve this issue is thus to just set the condition first.


```python
class Solution(object):
    def fizzBuzz(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: List[str]
        """
        
        result = []

        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:
                result.append("FizzBuzz")
            elif i % 3 == 0:
                result.append("Fizz")
            elif i % 5 == 0:
                result.append("Buzz")
            else:
                result.append(str(i))
        
        return result
```
