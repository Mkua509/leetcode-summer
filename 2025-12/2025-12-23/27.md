Once again tackling a easy one cause I don't have much time lef tin the day.

Remove elemtn essentially remove the element that is inputed from an array.

First we use a poiunter `k`  to track the position where the next valid and non `val` element should go. The function then loops throughe very element in the array. If the element at current position is not equal to `val` its copied into position `k` essentially moving the numbers forward. Then `k` is incremeneted.

Once loop finished the first `k` elements of array contains all elements that are not equal to the value. Then the array is returned to the length of `k`/


```python
class Solution(object):
    def removeElement(self, nums, val):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type val: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        k = 0

        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] != val:
                nums[k] = nums[i]
                k += 1

        return k

```
