1. Input root of a tree
2. Output the maximum diameter of the tree

Holy I have a fat headache, i'm def sick and I feel like so groggy idk man I can't think straight, all i really remember to solve this question from CS220 was to use dfs. But i did not realize that you had to create a secondary function inside of the existing function. Otherwise using recursion once again which these types of questions really love.

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution(object):
    def diameterOfBinaryTree(self, root):
        self.result = 0

        def dfs(root):
            if not root:
                return 0
            
            left = dfs(root.left)
            right = dfs(root.right)

            self.result = max(self.result, left + right)

            return 1 + max(left, right)

        dfs(root)
        return self.result

```
